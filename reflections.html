        <h2>My Learning up to this point:</h2>
        <p>- I've always been a slow and steady learner, though I can learn some things quickly when needed</p>
        <p>- I've learned a lot of valuable and fundamental concepts about computers and software ever since I started at Bradley</p>
        <p>- Despite all the concepts about software that I've learned, there's still so much for me to learn about</p><br>

        <h2>Where I am currently with my life:</h2>
        <p>- Just trying to find a job that can put my skills I've acquired in college to good use</p>
        <p>- Still don't entirely know what specifically about my degree I'd want to be hard pursuing in</p>
        <p>- I'm hoping once I've accumulated enough money I can get a car for myself. Till then, I have to use Uber or ask family to drive me</p>
        <p>- I'll have to take a good bit of time after graduation to save up so I can finally get my own home</p>
        <p>- I hope to get myself a little more physically active outside of work now that classes are done for me</p><br>
