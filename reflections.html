        <h2>My Learning up to this point:</h2>
        <p>- I've always been a pretty slow learner, so it takes me a while to get used to and remember a lot of important information</p>
        <p>- I've learned a lot of valuable and fundamental concepts about computers and software since I plan to go into the computer industry after graduation</p>
        <p>- Despite all the concepts about software that I've learned, I still have a long way to go before I'm actually efficient with making my own software</p><br>

        <h2>Where I am currently with my life:</h2>
        <p>- It's been incredibly difficult to find a job as of late, even minimum wage jobs are barely hiring</p>
        <p>- I still don't know what exactly about the computer and software industry I want to be going into for work</p>
        <p>- In the next year or so I should plan to get my own car if I've accumulated enough money by then</p>
        <p>- I will have no choice but to live with family still after graduation so I can find a job and save enough money to get a place of my own</p>
        <p>- I hope that once I've graduated I'll be able to fit some time into my schedule to incorporate a consistent workout routine again. This school year has been quite work-heavy as of now</p><br>
